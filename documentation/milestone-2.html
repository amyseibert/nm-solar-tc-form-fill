<!--PWP Milestone 2-->
<!--Content Strategy-->
<!--My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:-->

<!--Welcome: A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Front End Developer. This welcome message will be overlaid on a large background image of my home office setup.-->

<!--About Me: This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations that I am a good personality fit for.-->

<!--Portfolio: I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.-->

<!--Contact: This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble. (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)-->
