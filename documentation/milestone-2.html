<!--PWP Milestone 2-->
<!--Content Strategy-->
<!--My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:-->

<!--Welcome: A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Front End Developer. This welcome message will be overlaid on a large background image of my home office setup.-->

<!--About Me: This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations that I am a good personality fit for.-->

<!--Portfolio: I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.-->

<!--Contact: This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble. (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)-->

<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<p>My one-page site will consist of the following sections:</p>

<p><strong>Welcome Section:</strong> This section will mainly consist of a heading stating in a few words what the page is for and a sub-heading of one sentence to explain a little further what can be accomplished with the site. There will also be a navbar at the top of the page that will allow the user to jump to any section of the page, and a button below the subheading that will allow the user to jump straight to the section that allows them to begin filling out info for the documents. The background of this section will be a photo, something bright and solar related</p>

<p><strong>How it Works Section:</strong> This section will consist of a heading and details of the 3 steps it takes to successfully use this website to generate documents. The three steps are fill, generate, and download. Each step will have an icon, a heading, and a short 1-2 sentence description going into a little more detail. The background of this will also be a photo, either solar related or something showing a happy customer or a stack of completed documents.</p>

<p><strong>Data Entry Section:</strong> This section will be broken into four subsections for the four types of data needed to complete the documents. These subsections are customer info, installer info, system info, and pricing info. Each of these subsections will be visually separated from each other, and will contain titled data fields that make it clear to the user what information needs to be filled in. At the bottom of the section will be a "create documents" button and a "download documents" button.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps Section:</strong> This section will outline in simple, general terms what users can tell their customers in terms of their next steps, once they receive their documents. This will include a link to the submission website.</p>
