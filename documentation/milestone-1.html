<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This Project will be a website that allows the user to input data into fields.</p>
    <p><em>Stretch goal:</em> The site will then generate documents using pre-made templates that are filled out using the data input by the user.</p>
  <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>This website is designed for professionals in the solar industry, specifically those in charge of filling out the documents that must be prepared and sent to solar customers in order for them to be able to claim their New Mexico solar tax credit. Target audience: solar company owners, management, employees, and other industry professionals.</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this site is to enable users to fill out key customer information in designated data fields.
