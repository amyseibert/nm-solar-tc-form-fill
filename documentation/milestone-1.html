    <h3>Site Use Scenario</h3>
      <p>This website will be used after a project is completed in order to complete the state tax credit documents for each customer.</p>
    <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
      <p>Bill has two main problems when it comes to preparing the required state tax documents for his customers. First, he knows that company time and resources are currently being wasted on preparing the documents and that this will only get worse as his company continues to grow. His employees are all busy doing the jobs they do best so he has had to take over this task which wastes a minimum of 2 hours per project. Also, the format and exact requirements for the documents change often, requiring even more company time to be spent when documents need to be re-done if the customer doesn't submit them before new changes are made. Second, Bill knows that this is an area that is damaging his customer's experience with his company. Because there is a limited budget for the tax credit each year, documents must be submitted by the customer immediately after project completion to avoid missing out on the credit altogether. Bill knows that he needs a faster way to complete these documents in order to address these two problems.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>Bill has one main goal: To cut down the 2 hours it currently takes to complete each customer's state solar tax credit documents as much as possible.</p>
    <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As an advanced user, I need a simple, well-thought-out website that will help me or my employees to complete the required state solar tax credit documents in under 2 hours per project.</p>
